# Known Limitations

> **Fork note:** this is the [kgforais1/k-dense-byok-mcp](https://github.com/kgforais1/k-dense-byok-mcp) fork of [K-Dense-AI/k-dense-byok](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/k-dense-byok).

K-Dense BYOK is in beta. Kady is a single flat agent on the [Pi coding-agent SDK](https://pi.dev) with file/shell tools and a `subagent` delegation tool (pi-subagents). The limitations worth knowing are below.

## Skills depend on model quality

Scientific skills are markdown procedures (`SKILL.md`) the agent discovers in its sandbox and follows with its tools. How faithfully that happens depends on the selected model:

- **Skill activation is not always reliable.** Models sometimes skip a relevant skill, use it partially, or misinterpret the skill's instructions - especially complex multi-step skills that require strict adherence to a procedure.
- **Tool-calling consistency varies across models.** Some models occasionally drop tool calls or call tools with incorrect arguments, which can stall a task or produce incomplete results.
- **Long-context degradation.** When a skill injects a large amount of context (detailed protocols, multiple reference databases), models may lose track of earlier instructions.
- **Structured output can drift.** For skills that require specific output formats (tables, JSON, citations), models sometimes deviate from the requested structure.

These are limitations of the selected model, not of K-Dense BYOK itself; as model tool calling improves, skill execution improves automatically.

**Workarounds:**

- If a skill isn't behaving as expected, try **re-running the task** - results can vary between runs.
- Try a different model in the dropdown. OpenRouter entries advertise `tools` support, while connected subscription entries come from Pi's live provider catalogue; tool-calling quality still varies across both.

## Some models refuse the skills index

Anthropic's Mythos-class models run a safety classifier over the whole request before generating anything. On **Claude Fable 5** that classifier rejects a request whose system prompt lists certain seeded scientific skills — the refusal fires on the skill *description* alone, with nothing sensitive in the conversation at all.

What you see is a run that fails immediately, reporting `Provider finish_reason: content_filter` and zero input tokens. A refusal carries no token usage, so nothing is billed. It happens on the lead agent and on subagents alike (children inherit the lead's model), and it is not a K-Dense bug — the same request refuses when sent straight to the provider.

Skills verified to trigger it individually on `anthropic/claude-fable-5` (2026-08-27), all bio-design or pathogen adjacent:

`adaptyv` · `diffdock` · `ginkgo-cloud-lab` · `glycoengineering` · `pathogen-variant-surveillance` · `phylogenetics` · `tamarind`

**Workarounds:**

- **Switch the chat's model.** Claude Opus 4.8, Claude Sonnet 5, and GPT-5.5 accept the same prompt. If subagents were the ones failing, note they inherit the lead's model unless a specialist pins its own in its frontmatter.
- **Disable the skills you don't need** under Settings → Skills, then open a new chat tab — a live session keeps the skills it already loaded.

When a run fails this way, the error in the chat names the triggering skills that are currently enabled, so you do not have to bisect them by hand. That list is empirical and providers retune their classifiers, so treat it as a starting point rather than a fixed set.

## Ollama / small local models

Local models served through Ollama are supported end-to-end, but they amplify the caveats above:

- Tool-calling fidelity is noticeably weaker on sub-frontier models.
- Skills that rely on multi-tool choreography (running scripts, chaining edits, structured output) are the most fragile.

If a task loops or ignores its skill, try a **larger local model** (or temporarily switch to a frontier OpenRouter or connected subscription model) before assuming the workflow is broken. See [Local models with Ollama](./local-models-ollama.md).

## Pi subscription providers

Kady supports Pi OAuth for OpenAI Codex (ChatGPT Plus/Pro), Anthropic (Claude Pro/Max), GitHub Copilot, and xAI, with these boundaries:

- **Provider limits are external.** Kady cannot read remaining subscription quota, premium requests, overage settings, or plan eligibility. A successful OAuth login does not mean usage is free or unlimited.
- **Reference price is not an invoice.** For OpenAI Codex, Copilot, and xAI, Kady tracks tokens and Pi's list-price equivalent but excludes it from project spend caps. Check the provider for actual quota or overage status.
- **Anthropic OAuth is different.** Pi documents third-party Claude subscription access as metered extra per-token usage. Kady treats that amount as project spend and applies the cap.
- **Direct-provider entries require OAuth.** Ambient OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot, or xAI API keys are not presented as subscription access; use OpenRouter for the supported API-key path.
- **Some features still require OpenRouter.** Fusion and server-side speech transcription are not authorized by subscription logins.

## Local shell trust boundary

Kady's agent intentionally has a powerful local shell so it can install scientific packages, run analyses, and create artifacts. The shell runs as your operating-system user; it is not an OS-level security boundary. File permissions such as `0600` prevent other users from reading credentials, but cannot prevent a process running as you from reading your own `.env`, `~/.kady`, or other local secrets.

Kady instructs newly created project agents never to inspect or transmit credentials, but instructions are not a substitute for isolation against malicious prompt injection. Do not ask Kady to process adversarial files with secrets accessible to the same account. Use an OS sandbox, container, VM, or separate user account when working with untrusted content or when a stronger credential boundary is required.

- **The raw-data guard is heuristic.** It blocks recognizable mutations of protected paths and pauses recognizable destructive shell commands ([details](./data-guard.md)), for Kady and for background specialists. It does not parse shell semantics or inspect what a script does internally, so it reduces ordinary agent mistakes rather than enforcing a boundary. Keep backups of irreplaceable raw data.

### Installed skills are instructions, not data

A skill is a procedure the agent follows using that same shell, so installing one from a third-party source widens this boundary to whoever wrote it. Kady requires an explicit acknowledgement before an install and shows the parsed skills first, but it does not audit their contents: review a source you do not already trust, and prefer pinning a branch or tag. Installed skills are deliberately never auto-updated — a new version is flagged and waits for you, because silently pulling changed instructions into a running project is worse than a stale skill. See [Skill management](./skill-management.md).

## Tabbed chats

- **Hard cap of 10 tabs per project.** This keeps the browser snappy and
  bounds the number of parallel SSE streams to the backend. Close an
  existing tab before opening a new one once you hit the limit.
- **Refresh recovery requires the backend to stay running.** Browser refreshes
  and browser-tab closes preserve project workspaces, chat tabs, drafts,
  queues, and live turns. Stopping or restarting the Kady backend still ends
  in-flight turns; completed conversation history remains on disk and can be
  reopened from Chat history.
- **Workflows launch into the active tab.** If you have a long-running
  turn streaming in tab A and click Launch on a workflow while tab B is
  active, the workflow runs in tab B. Switch to the tab you want to
  receive the workflow before launching.

## Web access

Native web access ([pi-web-access](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-web-access)) gives Kady and the sub-agents `web_search` and `fetch_content` (pages, PDFs, GitHub repos, YouTube). A few edges:

- **No key = shared fallback.** Without an Exa / Perplexity / Gemini key (Settings → API keys), searches go through a free Exa fallback that can rate-limit under heavy use. Adding any one key removes that bottleneck.
- **Video understanding needs a Gemini key.** YouTube and local-video analysis are only available once `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set.
- **PDF extraction is text-only.** Scanned PDFs without a text layer are not OCRed.
- **Web access for sub-agents applies to new chat tabs**, same as agent and MCP edits below.

## Sub-agents

Sub-agent delegation ([docs](./sub-agents.md)) works end-to-end, with a couple of edges:

- **Sub-agents can't use MCP tools yet.** Tools from connected [MCP servers](./mcp-servers.md) are available to Kady itself but not to the sub-agents it spawns. Making them available to sub-agents is on the roadmap.
- **Per-agent model overrides must name an available model.** If you set a model on an agent in Settings → Specialists, use an id from the model dropdown; an unrecognized id falls back to the default model rather than failing.
- **Sub-agents ask through Kady, with a timeout.** A background specialist can pause and ask for a decision (pi-subagents' `contact_supervisor`). The request reaches the chat as a "Subagent needs a decision" card, Kady relays it to you with the interview form and answers the specialist. The specialist waits at most ten minutes, then continues with an error; a closed browser still lets the server adopt the turn, but nobody answers until a tab is open. Specialists do not get the `interview` tool themselves.
- **Specialist memory is self-written.** Per-agent `MEMORY.md` files are instructions the model wrote for itself, injected into later runs. They are not verified and are a prompt-injection surface; review or clear them from Settings → Specialists.
- **Watchdog spend is invisible.** pi-subagents does not report the watchdog model's usage, so its calls are not ledgered and do not count toward the spend cap ([details](./watchdog.md)).
- **External-CLI specialists bypass Kady's accounting.** pi-subagents ships `claude-code`, `codex-exec`, `cursor-agent` and their `-writer` variants, which shell out to a locally installed and authenticated Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor CLI. They run outside Kady's model runtime, cost ledger, and spend cap, so they are disabled by default; enable them in Settings → Specialists only if you understand that their usage is billed by that CLI's own account.
- **A specialist on a local model can overstate its context window.** Kady reads the real window from your server ([details](./local-models-ollama.md#context-length)), but that figure lives in the Kady server's memory and a specialist runs in its own process, where an unknown window defaults to 128,000. So a specialist pinned to a local model whose loaded window is genuinely smaller declares the default while the main chat declares the real figure. In practice the main chat is on the same model and hits the limit first; if you do see a specialist send an oversized request, declare `contextWindow` for that model as a [custom model server](./custom-model-servers.md).
- **Changes apply to new chat tabs.** Agents edited in Settings (and MCP server changes) take effect in tabs opened afterwards; already-running tabs keep the setup they started with.

## Schedules

- **Timers live in the server.** A schedule fires only while the Kady server is running; a due slot missed during downtime runs once at the next boot when `catchUp` is `latest`. Runs are skipped, not queued, when the previous one is still going.
- **The cap acts after the fact.** A schedule fire cannot be gated when it runs. Kady checks the cap when a schedule is created or run by hand, pauses active schedules once a project is over its limit, and resumes them when it clears — but the run that crossed the line is ledgered, not prevented.
- **Panel actions run through the resident session.** Pause, resume, run-now and delete call pi-subagents' own management actions with no model involved; if the resident session cannot be opened (for example no model is configured), those buttons fail with an error while the chat path still works.

## Modal compute

Modal jobs are durable, restart-recoverable, available to sub-agents, and
tracked in the center-panel Compute tab. The remaining boundaries are:

- **Displayed cost is an estimate.** Modal does not expose a generally available
  per-sandbox final invoice API. K-Dense reserves worst-case estimated cost and
  reconciles it to elapsed resource time on every terminal path.
- **Multi-GPU is single-sandbox.** K-Dense can request multiple GPUs and run
  bounded groups of independent jobs, but it does not orchestrate multi-node
  distributed training.
- **The local sandbox remains canonical.** Remote Volumes cache dependencies,
  models, and reference data; they are not a second copy of the project
  workspace.
- **Security scope is narrower than provenance scope.** Remote jobs do not
  receive model credentials by default; fine-grained egress policy and per-job
  secrets remain future work. Provenance does cover remote work: every terminal
  Modal job is recorded as a `compute` step with the transfer layer's own
  input/output hashes (see [Provenance](./provenance.md)), though the remote
  image's installed packages are not enumerated the way the local venv's are.

See [Durable Modal compute](./modal-compute.md) for lifecycle and recovery details.

## Native Windows has less mileage

The app runs natively on Windows 10/11 (no WSL needed) and goes through the same test suite as macOS/Linux, but it has had less real-world use — if you hit something Windows-specific, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/kgforais1/k-dense-byok-mcp/issues). Git for Windows is required there because the agent's shell tool uses Git Bash. WSL remains a supported alternative.

## Context compaction

- **The summary is model-written.** Kady prepends a state block derived from its own stores (plan, notebook entries, result ids, environment), but the narrative part is generated by the chat model and can still paraphrase or omit detail. Check the lab notebook and provenance log for the authoritative record.
- **Compacting aborts nothing but is not free.** "Compact now" is refused while a run streams; the summary call is billed to the session like a turn.

## Not built in

First-party literature/regulatory search, document conversion, browser automation, and automated citation verification are not built into Kady. Many of these can be added by connecting an [MCP server](./mcp-servers.md); the `citation-checker` specialist covers reference checking with the web tools. Record-keeping is covered by per-artifact [provenance](./provenance.md), the notebook's [Methods draft](./lab-notebook.md#methods-draft), and [evidence packages](./evidence-packages.md); none of these verifies scientific claims on your behalf.
