/**
 * Provenance for durable Modal compute jobs.
 *
 * A remote job is the one kind of step whose file effects the transfer layer
 * already measures exactly: `stageInputs` hashes every input as it uploads it
 * and `collectOutputs` hashes every output as it installs it. Those hashes were
 * taken at the moment the bytes crossed the boundary, so unlike a harvested
 * subagent step they need no "hashed later" caveat — they are `observed`, at
 * write time.
 *
 * The job record is server-owned and restart-recoverable, so this is derived
 * from it rather than from the agent's `modal_*` tool call. The lead's own
 * `modal_run`/`modal_wait` call is still recorded by the recorder as an opaque
 * tool (its scan-diff sees the outputs land), so a remote artifact usually has
 * two producing steps: the agent's call, and this one naming the instance, the
 * remote command, and the image it ran in.
