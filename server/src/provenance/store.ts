 * (.kady/notebook/<sessionId>.jsonl).
 *
 * Design principle: rows here are DERIVED FROM OBSERVATION, never from model
 * declaration. The agent has no tool that writes to this store — the run loop
 * does, from Pi's event stream. Provenance is what you check the model against,
 * so a record the model could author would defeat its own purpose.
 *
 * Every artifact edge therefore carries a `confidence`. An edge we could only
 * infer is never presented as an observed fact; see recorder.ts for how each
 * tool class earns its level.
